# World Cup Alpha — standing rules for AI sessions

Real money is live on this system. Read this before changing anything.
Where this file and older docs disagree, this file + `ARCHITECTURE.md` win.

## Goal & spec

Quant betting on the 2026 World Cup (football ONLY). PRIMARY: advancement /
knockout futures on Polymarket. SECONDARY: maximum extraction from boosts and
returning-customer offers (matched or high-EV unmatched). Model = Elo +
Dixon-Coles + de-vigged market blend, then **shrunk toward the de-vigged market
reference** before it drives edge/EV/sizing (the `shrink` family, promoted from
shadow to LIVE 2026-07-09 — see the shrink kill-switch under Live-money gates);
**CLV is the primary KPI** — a market without price capture + CLV stamping does
not get real money.

## Sizing (single source of truth)

**ONE combined bankroll: £3,000 ± TOTAL realised P&L across GBP books AND
Polymarket** ($↔£ at the fixed $1.33/£), **¼-Kelly of the running total**,
expressed in £ for GBP venues and $ for PM (same pot, FX'd — never per-venue
£3,000 each; that double-counts). Implemented in `wca.markets.bankroll` +
`card.full_pools()` / `resolve_pool_bankroll()` (`WCA_FULL_POOLS=0` restores
the legacy split; the CLV rung ladder is reference-only). Execution caps are
static fail-closed constants (`pm/trader.py`: $160/order, $1,000/day, $400
cash-out; fire backstop $200) — changing them is a human-approved code change.

## Selection rules (encoded, do not regress)

**The rule lives in ONE place: `src/wca/selection.py`.** Every bet-ranking /
selection / sizing surface imports it (`bucket_rank`, `longshot_no_cash`,
`hours_out`, `hours_out_term`, `resolve_market_kind`, `preference_sort_key`);
it is a **human-approved-change file** like the execution caps — editing
`PROB_BUCKETS` / `LONGSHOT_PROB` / `hours_out_term` / `preference_sort_key`
moves ALL real-money orderings at once. Full spec + the per-surface compliance
table: `docs/SELECTION_RULES.md`.

Canonical rule (user-confirmed 2026-07-07; category-conditional refinement
2026-07-09), key `(bucket_rank, hours_term, -ev)`:
- **Bucket by MODEL prob (PRIMARY)**: moneyline `≥0.50` / mid `0.25–0.50` /
  longshot `<0.25` (inclusive lower bounds). A higher bucket ALWAYS ranks above
  a lower one, regardless of EV.
- **Further-out fixtures first (SECONDARY) — CATEGORY-CONDITIONAL (2026-07-09)**:
  kept ONLY for multi-week **futures/advancement** (raw hours descending, or the
  stage-depth analogue); **NEUTRALISED for 90-min match markets** (contributes
  0), so EV breaks ties within the bucket. Basis: backtest 2026-07-09 (n=1,046
  resolved PM markets, composition-controlled, look-ahead-guarded) — match PM
  efficiency is FLAT 168h→kickoff (Brier 0.131→0.124, CIs overlap; ~0 after
  fees, small penalty <12h), while multi-week futures show a real +6–7% early
  edge at 24–72h (n=60). The conditional lives in `hours_out_term`; the SAFE
  DEFAULT is match (hours-neutral) — futures OPT IN via `market_kind` /
  settlement / category. `bucket_rank` + `longshot_no_cash` UNCHANGED.
- **EV breaks ties**: the effective secondary key for match markets (hours
  neutral); the tertiary tie-break within bucket + further-out tier for futures.
- **No cash on longshots (`<0.25` model)**: strict floor — free-bet/lottery only
  (stake forced to 0, flagged, may still be DISPLAYED dimmed). `longshot_no_cash`
  is applied at the SIZING step, kept SEPARATE from the sort so a surface can
  show a longshot dimmed while sizing it at zero.
- **REPLACE ruling (2026-07-07)**: "longshot" is now defined PURELY by model
  prob `<0.25`. This RETIRES the older 2026-06-29 "cut all market
  outright-underdogs regardless of prob" decision — a market outsider the model
  rates 25–49% is now a STAKEABLE MID. The market-relative FAV/2ND-FAV/longshot
  categories (`card.classify_outcome` / `_CATEGORY_PRIORITY`) survive ONLY as
  cosmetic DISPLAY labels; they no longer feed the sort key or the cash-cut.
- Killed as −EV leaks (do NOT resurrect for cash): correct score, scorer
  props, un-boosted SGMs. Boost-hedged SGMs are different: `wca.boostlock`.
- Whole-book: size ALL bets together; worst case respects the hard cash floor.

## Display conventions (user-chosen, do not "improve")

- **"TRADE" NOT "BET" IN DISPLAY TEXT (user ruling 2026-07-08):** all
  user-visible copy says trade/trades/trading — site labels and titles, bot
  message templates and help descriptions, dashboards, docs prose about the
  product. Wire format and identifiers are UNCHANGED: command names
  (`/bets`, `/settle`, `Y BET-<id>`), JSON keys/filenames (`bet_recs.json`,
  `bet_rec`, `n_bets`), the `bets` DB table, script/module names
  (`wca_betrecs.py`), launchd labels. Venue brands (bet365, Betfair,
  Sky Bet…), bookmaker product terms ("Bet Builder", "free bet", "betslip")
  and ledger/accounting echoes stay verbatim.
- **PERCENTAGES EVERYWHERE (user ruling 2026-07-08 — SUPERSEDES the
  2026-07-03 "classic decimal" /card line, do not revert):** ALL bot
  commands display odds as percentages (`model X% / mkt Y%`), never bare
  decimal odds. Where a book's decimal price is the executable number it is
  shown as its implied % with the venue tagged (`back 24.5% impl via
  polymarket`). Polymarket's ¢ convention stays — ¢ IS a percent. Shared
  helpers: `wca.displayfmt` (formatting only, no gate/sizing logic).
  Scope: TRADE-DISPLAY surfaces. Ledger/accounting echoes (`/bets`,
  `/settle`, betslip-ingest verification) keep the venue's booked decimal —
  they reconcile against what the book shows, not a recommendation.
- **+EV indicated everywhere (same ruling):** every displayed selection
  carries its edge (pp for prob-gaps, % for EV-per-unit) plus an explicit
  `✅+EV` / `❌−EV` marker (`EV?` when no live price — a missing price is
  never dressed up as +EV), and the `wca.selection` ordering stays visible
  (ML/MID/LS bucket tags, moneylines over longshots).
- `/card`: percent format as above, `[elo/dc]` bracket, stake in the pick's
  own pool currency, verbose CUT reasons, WATCH tier (near-threshold 0–2pp
  rows + withheld-by-gate reason_code summary — display widened, gates
  UNCHANGED), scorelines appendix. NO bankroll-model footer.
- `/matchevents`: exotic event markets filtered to +EV MONEYLINE-bucket
  (model ≥50% AND positive net edge) only; killed-for-cash markets (correct
  score / scorer props / un-boosted SGMs) structurally excluded; model-only
  rows labelled "+EV unverifiable", honest feed-missing hints.
- `/goalscorers`: model % vs market implied % per scorer, <25% model legs
  NO-CASH, and the −73.9% scorer-punt leak warning on every scorer surface.
- `/pm` + Action Desk trade ideas: Polymarket ¢ convention, $ stakes,
  bucket-grouped (moneylines → mid → longshots), hours-out tags
  (`site/pm_ideas.json` feed), +EV markers per row.
- 1X2 settles at 90 minutes; PM advancement includes ET+pens — the two must
  never be visually confusable; settlement basis is flagged on every surface.

## Live-money gates

- `PM_DRY_RUN` gates PM execution (mini `.env` = LIVE). Never arm live from
  the dev box. Proposals park in `pm_parked`; a human `Y PM-<n>` fires
  (single Y can fire a tagged BATCH — check `/pm` first).
- Model changes ship SHADOW-FIRST (dual-written, CLV-compared) before they
  touch pricing or sizing. F7 goal-blend is in shadow now (`gb_lambda_*`).
- **Shrink-to-market is LIVE** (graduated from shadow 2026-07-09, user-approved).
  `p' = p_mkt + k*(p_model − p_mkt)` per leg (`k=0.5` for model legs ≥0.25,
  `k=0.25` below), renormalised — applied in `wca.card._iter_fixture_blends`, so
  the LIVE `model` line the card + `betrecs` + `eventmarkets` bet against is the
  shrunk one; the RAW blend is preserved as `blended_raw` / `model_raw` and the
  scoreboard still scores raw→shrunk→market. **Kill-switch `WCA_SHRINK_LIVE`
  (default ON)** — set `WCA_SHRINK_LIVE=0` to restore the exact pre-promotion
  raw-blend behaviour (reversible, no data migration). `advancement.py`
  recomputes 1X2 from live odds and is NOT affected. Evidence: backtest n=383
  model-vs-PM (model on the wrong side of PM ~75% when they disagree ≥2pp),
  per-leg calibration n=99, `shrink` shadow brierΔ −0.0046 at n=75.
- New markets need: price capture, CLV stamping, settlement automation —
  before real money.

## Data discipline

- "What's live" = `origin/main`. The canonical ledger `data/wca.db` lives
  ONLY on the Mac mini — never mutate it from the dev box; read it over SSH
  with `sqlite3.connect` + `PRAGMA query_only=ON` (`-readonly` fails, WAL).
- Never commit stale branch data over CI-fresh data (`site/*.json`,
  `data/*_latest.md` are daemon/CI-written).
- `data/raw/results.csv` LAGS 2–3 days — don't treat absence as "not played".
- No fabricated numbers, ever: every reported figure comes from a computation
  actually run, with n stated; unverifiable claims are labelled.

## Ops

- Mini = production (ssh `andrewdoherty@Drews-Mac-mini.local` — the .55 IP is
  stale), repo `~/World-Cup-26`, launchd `com.wca.*`. Deploy = merge to main
  → autopull (5 min) or manual pull; **new launchd jobs need
  `bash deploy/macmini/install.sh` run on the mini by a human**.
- Unwedge recipe: back up dirty tracked files FIRST (tar), then
  `git reset --hard origin/main`, then kickstart. Agents never run destructive
  recovery unprompted.
- The conductor may switch this repo's branch mid-session: verify the branch
  before every commit; use scratchpad worktrees for multi-step builds
  (venv resolves `wca` to the main repo — set `PYTHONPATH=<worktree>/src`).
- Tests: `./.venv/bin/pytest -q` must be green before push; the CI gate is
  advisory-only (free-plan private repo), so local green is the real gate.
- Telegram: ops/trades via @gamble1_bot; code via @WorldCupDev conductor
  (never places bets). Progress pings go to the TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID chat.

## Session handoffs

Current state-of-play + ranked work queue: `docs/HANDOFF_2026-07-03.md`
(branch map, environment topology incl. the PM network block + VPN/LAN
trade-off, live watch-items, /task templates). Conductor agents: read it
before starting any task.

## Standing decisions

- Betfair execution: NO-BUILD (ADR-003). Read-only CLV reference at most;
  Smarkets first if a GBP exchange is ever needed.
- Sites: localhost-ONLY — `site/` (8000) primary, `site-analytics/` (8001)
  frozen pending consolidation (post-tournament); publish via the mini
  `publish` job. Vercel REMOVED entirely 2026-07-08 (no hosted deploys).
- Overhaul plan + gates: `docs/overhaul/PHASE1_DESIGN.md` (tournament track
  vs post-tournament track); rollback tag `pre-overhaul-2026-07-01`.
